str = "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\n\
Explicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\n\
Complex is better than complicated.\nFlat is better than nested.\n\
Sparse is better than dense.\nReadability counts.\n\
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\nAlthough\
practicality beats purity.\nErrors should never pass silently.\n\
Unless explicitly silenced.\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the\
temptation to guess.\nThere should be one-- and preferably only\
one --obvious way to do it.\nAlthough that way may not be obvious\
at first unless you're Dutch.\nNow is better than never.\n\
Although never is often better than *right* now.\n\
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n\
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n\
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!"
